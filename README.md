## Project Overview
The Mobile Price Classification project aims to classify mobile phones into different price ranges using their specifications. The model is built using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, which has been optimized for better performance.

## Features
- Predicts mobile phone price ranges based on various specifications.
- Utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.
- Optimized hyperparameters for improved accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes various features of mobile phones, such as:
- Battery capacity
- Screen size
- RAM
- Internal memory
- Camera resolution
- Mobile weight
- Connectivity features (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, 4G support)

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sumoondev/Mobile-Price-Classification.git
   cd Mobile-Price-Classification/FDS
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
## Usage
To use the application, run the main script or Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository. The steps include:

## Load the dataset.
Preprocess the data (handle missing values, normalize features).
Train the SVM model with the training data.
Evaluate the model on the test data.

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the SVM classifier for better results.

## Results
The SVM classifier achieved a high accuracy rate in predicting mobile phone price ranges. Detailed results, including confusion matrices and classification reports, are available in the results section of the notebook.
